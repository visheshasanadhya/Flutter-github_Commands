# ** Setup Commands**

## üîß GitHub Repository Setup

```bash
git init                                   # Initialize a new Git repository
git add .                                  # Stage all files for commit
git commit -m "first commit"               # Commit with message
git branch -M main                         # Rename current branch to main
git remote add origin <your_repo_url>      # Add GitHub remote repository
git push -u origin main                    # Push code to GitHub main branch
```

---

## üîÅ **Basic Git Workflow**

```bash
git checkout main                          # Switch to existing branch
git checkout -b new_branch                 # Create and switch to a new branch
git branch                                 # View all local branches # Check if main exists locally
git pull origin main                       # Pull latest changes from remote main
git clone <repo_url>                       # Clone an existing GitHub repository
```
---

## **Git is asking for your GitHub login   **


```bash
git remote set-url origin <Github repo link>       # <Github repo link - https://github.com/visheshasanadhya/  .git>
git push -u origin main

```

**Generate and use a Personal Access Token:**

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic).
2. Click Generate new token,
3. select:repo (full control for private/public repos)
4. Set an expiry date.
5. Copy the token (you won‚Äôt see it again).
6. In the terminal, when it asks for a password, paste this token instead.

It will ask for:

```bash
Username for 'https://github.com': your_github_username
Password for 'https://github.com': <paste your token here>

```
## methord 2 -

1. The URL in your Git repo is still using HTTPS without the token

If you just run git push and enter username/token, it should work ‚Äî but if it keeps failing, you can embed the token directly into your remote URL to skip prompts:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<USERNAME>:<TOKEN>@github.com/visheshasanadhya/BMDU-E_Commerce-_app.git
Example (replace <USERNAME> and <TOKEN>):
```
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://visheshasanadhya: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@github.com/visheshasanadhya/BMDU-E_Commerce-_app.git
```
Then push:

```bash
git push -u origin main

```

## üåê **Setup Git In system Commands**


To check your Git username and email configuration, use the following commands in your terminal:
1. To view all Git configuration settings, including username and email:
Code
```bash
git config --list
This command displays all configured Git settings. Look for user.name and user.email in the output.
```
2. To view only your Git username:
Code
```bash
git config user.name
```
3. To view only your Git email:
Code
```bash
git config user.email
```
4. To check global-level username configuration specifically:
Code
```bash
git config --global user.name
```
5. To check global-level email configuration specifically:
Code
```bash
git config --global user.email
```
These commands will display the configured values if they are set. If no output is returned, it means the specific configuration is not set at that level (global or local, depending on whether --global is used).

## üìò **Git History & Cleanup**

```bash
git status                                 # Check status of files

git log --oneline                          # View one-line commit history
git checkout -- filename                   # Discard uncommitted changes to a file
git rm --cached filename                   # Untrack file but keep it locally
rm -rf .git && git init                    # Delete Git history and start fresh
git reset --hard                           # Reset all changes to last commit
git branch -d main                         # Delete branch locally in system
git push origin --delete main              # Delete branch from GitHub too (if pushed)
git checkout main                          # switch back to your working branch (e.g., main)
git fetch --tags                           # fetch the tags from the remote first: tags (ex.-v1 and v2) build when release apk on github
git tag                                    # Then check the tags list: You should see v1 and v2 listed.
                                           
git checkout Calling-Api-Outside           # switch back to your working branch Calling-Api-Outside branch to GitHub
git push origin Calling-Api-Outside        # Push Calling-Api-Outside branch to GitHub
```

Sure Vishesha! Here's a **complete list of Flutter commands** you've either used before or will likely use often ‚Äî categorized for better clarity. These commands help in device setup, project management, dependency management, build, and debugging.

---

## üîÅ **DEVICE CONNECTION  &  EMULATOR RELATED**

To restart device
```bash
adb kill-server
adb start-server

```



```bash
ipconfig                                 # check IP of system
adb devices                           # First-Time Setup (Needs USB Once) and Enable Developer Options & USB Debugging on your phone
adb tcpip 5555                        # Enable Wireless Debugging
adb connect 192.168.29.27:5555        # adb connect <Your-Phone-IP> . Go to Settings ‚Üí About Phone ‚Üí Status or Wi-Fi details. 
flutter devices                        # List all connected devices

flutter emulators                     # List available emulators
flutter emulators --launch <id>       # Launch an emulator
flutter run                           # Run app on default device
flutter run -d <device_id>            # Run on specific device 
```

##To use web app by adb device


 Run Flutter web server bound to your IP
```bash
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname=0.0.0.0 --web-port=8080
```
This will serve the app on all network interfaces.


---

Open the URL on Android

In the Flutter console, you‚Äôll see something like:

Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080

Replace 0.0.0.0 with your actual IPv4 address from Step 1, e.g.:
```bash
http://192.168.1.5:8080
```
Make sure your Android device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

Open that link in Chrome (or any browser) on your Android device.
